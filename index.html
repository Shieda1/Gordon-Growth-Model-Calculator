    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the gordon growth model<br> 
    What is the gordon growth model?<br>
    the gordon growth model is a calculation of a firm's intrinsic value assuming that it's shares are worth the sum of it's future dividends discounted back to their present value.<br>
    How to calculate gordon growth model?<br>
    To calculate gordon growth model you should use the following formula:<br>
    p = D1 / (r - g)<br>
    where:<br>
    p = current stock price<br>
    g = constant growth rate expected for dividends,in perpetuity<br>
    r = constant cost of equity capital for the company(rate of return)<br>
    D1 = value of next year's dividends<br>
    example: A company's stock is trading at $160 per share. The company requires 6% minimum rate of return (r) and it will pay a $2 dividends per share in the next year(D1) which is expected to increase by 4% annually (g), calculate the current stock price.<br>
    ussing the gordon growth model formula the answer will be:<br>
    p = D1 / (r - g)<br>
    p = $2 / (0.06 - 0.4)<br>
    p = $100<br>
    The shares are $60 overvalued in the market according to the gordon growth model.<br>
    Why use gordon growth model?<br>
    Gordon growth model is used to determine the relationship between growth rates, discount rates and valuation. The model demonstrates a clear relation between valuation and return.<br>
